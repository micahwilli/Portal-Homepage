# Portal-Homepage
This collection of images and code are DIRECTLY from Esri. This code is from this Blog https://community.esri.com/blogs/baldy/2017/07/24/beautify-that-homepage-creating-a-unique-look-and-feel by Brian Baldwin. I wanted a place to keep my customized version on Git. Here it is. We use it for our own ArcGIS Portal homepage.
