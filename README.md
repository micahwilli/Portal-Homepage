# Portal-Homepage
This collection of images and HTML code is DIRECTLY from Esri. This code is from this Blog https://community.esri.com/blogs/baldy/2017/07/24/beautify-that-homepage-creating-a-unique-look-and-feel by Brian Baldwin. I wanted a place to keep my customized version on Git. Here it is. We use it for our own ArcGIS Portal homepage. '

This Customization can be seen several places around the internet but I have uploaded several images to this respostory to show what it is "Supposed" to look like. I have also uploaded a photoshop Document PSD for the proper size of the banner image. Hope this all helps someone.
